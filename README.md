# benchtools

Shared utilities used by other projects that benchmark
[Clojure](https://clojure.org/) and Java code.

Currently very unstable, not appropriate for use as a library.
The code itself may have examples that are useful starting 
points.

Builds with [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/), 
specifically the [clojure-maven-plugin](https://github.com/talios/clojure-maven-plugin).
